Shutdown an entire cloud
Note: The scripts are mostly untested

1) Stop all VM instances.
     See shutdown_instances.sh or do it manually

2) Stop chef-client on all nodes
     See shutdown_chef.sh or do it manually

3) Stop pacemaker with rcopenais command on the respective nodes  in the following order:
     Neutron-L3 cluster
     Other services cluster (nova, horizon, etc.)
     Data cluster (database and rabbitmq)

4) Shutdown all the nodes, but the admin node
     See shutdown_nodes.sh or do it manually

5) Shutdown the admin node


Startup

1) Turn on the admin node
2) Turn on the data related cluster system
     You can check the status of the cluster running "crm status"
     In the node where postgres is running you can run "su - postgres -c psql"
     In the node where rabbitmq is running you can run "rabbitmqctl list_vhosts"
     Turn on the services cluster
     If running ceph, then power on the ceph nodes
     Power on the Neutron L3 service cluster system
     Power on the compute nodes
     Manually run crm_mon -1r on the cluster to see if all services operate normal
3) Nodes might get stalled in state 'Readying' or 'Problem'. Reboot nodes if needed.
